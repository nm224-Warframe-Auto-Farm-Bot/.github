# Warframe Auto Farm – Farm Everything While AFK Like a Galactic Machine ⚙️🧬

In **Warframe**, farming is life — and that life can be **painfully repetitive**.

If you’re tired of grinding the hard way, it’s time to switch to full automation with the **Warframe Auto Farm Bot**. 💥

This cheat-based farming tool handles missions **automatically** — no clicks, no effort, just pure loot. Whether you want to max out your mastery, farm endo, credit stacks, or relics for Prime gear, this bot runs everything in the background while you chill.
